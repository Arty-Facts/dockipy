## Installation

```bash
pip install dockipy
```

### For remote access to hosts

```bash

sudo apt install tmux openssh-client 
```

make sure you have ssh keys setup for the remote hosts. 

```bash
ssh-keygen 

ssh-copy-id username@host
```


## What is `dockipy`?

`dockipy` is your ticket to productivity paradise, a simple yet mighty wrapper around the Docker command line interface. It's the friend who says, "Don't worry about the nitty-gritty, I got you!" Just lean back and let dockipy work its magic, it will mount you project in a container seamlessly. If it doesn't break then everything should be fine.

And here's the cherry on top: with `dockipy`, you can dive into a Python virtual environment inside your container. It's like a containerceptionâ€”codeceptionâ€”whatever you want to call it! Run your code with the ease, all thanks to dockipy.

But wait, there's a catch! Before you sail into the `dockipy`, make sure you have Docker installed. And if you're planning to use NVIDIA GPUs, brace yourself! Docker GPU driver installation is a mess, `dockipy` won't hold your hand through that chaosâ€”consider yourself warned!

#### How to Use dockipy
Ready to embark on your container adventure? Here's how dockipy can make your coding dreams come true:

Run Your Code: Use dockipy to run your code in a container inside a Python virtual environment within another container. It's like Inception, but for coding!
```bash
dockipy my_script.py
```

#### How to Use dockishell

Need to run an arbitrary command in a container? No problem! Just fire up dockishell and let the container magic begin.

```bash
dockishell nvidia-smi
```

#### How to Use dockibook
Want to unleash the power of Jupyter Notebooks in a container? Say no more! Use dockibook and open the link in your browser, colab or visual studio code.

```bash
dockibook .
```

#### Don't want to use Docker but still would like to use the configuration? No problem! Use envipy and envibook to run your code and notebooks in a virtual environment.
Since Windows is such a messy work with rawdogging your environment is totally okay.
```bash
envipy my_script.py
```
    
```bash
envibook .
```


## Configure environment
Tired of Docker feeling like a high-maintenance diva? Set up your environment like a pro with docki.yaml. No more Docker dramas, just smooth sailing.

```bash
docki --init
```

### docki.yaml

This file is used to specify the base image, system dependencies, and python dependencies for the Docker container.
If the file does not exist, a template will be created in the project root using docki --init.

base_image: The base image for the Docker container. You can find images on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

system_dep: A list of system dependencies to install in the Docker container. Install with apt-get.

python_dep: A list of python dependencies to install in the Docker container or a path to a requirements.txt file.

```yaml
base_image: nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-devel-ubuntu22.04 # base image for the container can find more on Docker Hub
shm_size: 16G # shared memory size
tag: docki # name of the container
system_dep: # list of system dependencies to install during the build
  - python3
  - python3-pip
  - python3-dev
  - python3-venv
system_commands: # list of system commands to run after installing system dependencies during the build
    - apt-get update
python_dep: # list or file of python dependencies to install
  file: ./requirements.txt
init_commands: # this will be run before as initial as you start the container
    - export ENV_VAR=VALUE
remote:
  hosts:
    - name: username@host1
    - name: username@host2
      workspace: /path/to/workspace
```

## Remote access to Hosts

You can add remote hosts to the docki.yaml file. This will allow you to run the container on a remote host. The workspace is the path to the project on the remote host. 

```yaml
remote:
  hosts:
    - name: username@host1
    - name: username@host2
      workspace: /path/to/workspace
``` 

### How to run the container on a remote host

```bash
dockipy --remote 
```

```bash

## Is something went wrong? 

You can stop or kill the container with the following commands. It will use the tag from the docki.yaml file to stop or kill the container.

```bash
dockikill
```

```bash
dockistop
```
But this is not happening often, right? ðŸ¤ž

## TODO
- [ ] Add support Windows Notebooks
- [ ] Add support for Docker GPU driver installation on WLS2
- [ ] Add support for Mac. I don't have a Mac! Pls send donations to my [onlyfans](https://onlyfans.com/arty-facts) so that i can afford one!
